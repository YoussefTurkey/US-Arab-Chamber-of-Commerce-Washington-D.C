                        certificates of origin (C/O) and related export documents in which they are placed to under (C/O) and (C/I), as governments 
                        and customs may require our stamp because they are exporting products to Arab countries or it is required in a letter of credit 
                        between them and their customers located in one of the Arab countries.
                    </p>
                    <p>We got knowledge of the laws that that pertain to exporting from the US, as well as the relevant laws of other countries. 
                        There are measures that can be taken by the US Arab Chamber of commerce in the panning process to minimize the probability

                        multiple fast growing American businesses such as several American oil industries and American educational institutions; 
                        All these bilateral corporations are influenced by political agreements between the Arab embassies towards the US world, 
                        which we care to ease these legal services and could cover most of the business world needs through our services.

                        relationship will be the corner stone to build on it such sustainable relationships.
